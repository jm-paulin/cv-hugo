        Date: July 2021 - June 2022
        Description: >
          A crucial customer required an integration of our legacy products migrated to kubernetes 
          with their own SAML Identity Provider. I was in charge of driving the tactical changes required
          to deliver this capability within our cloud product 
        Details:
          - Design and implement the changes required to support this new scenario.
          - Ensure the solution did not affect any existing customers and functionalities

        Description: >
          RedHat OpenShift is our main target. But some of our customers are already invested in other Kubernetes platforms. 
          My role as Technical Leader was to make sure our core cloud product can also be deployed on more generic Kubernetes 
          platforms such as Rancher or Kubeadm. As part of a small 3 person team we:
        Details:
        - > 
          Developed ansible scripts to deploy kubeadm based cluster for verification testing. 
          This included provisioning nodes from our internal cloud services, configuring reverse proxy, bastion hosting.
        - > 
          Implemented changes in our core charts to enable Ingress (specifically ingress-nginx). Openshift is using the alternative concept of Routes.
        - >
          Defined and rolled out a common strategy across our various development teams to secure TLS connection within the cluster, 
          but not using a certificate manager as to not impose a technical solution for our customers.
        - Implemented CI/CD dedicated pipeline with Jenkins.
        - Directly supported multiple Proof-of-Concept projects with various customers.

      - Title: Senior Software Engineer / Technical Leader
        Date: Jul 2018 - Dec 2019
        Description: >
          Existing customers do not want to lose their existing
          Netcool investment, but still want to use our new cloud analytics capabilities. 
          As part of this we had to not only rework our deployment to allow connectivity 
          with an existing on-prem infrastructure, but also find an acceptable single sign-on 
          solution to authenticate our cloud services with the existing customer SSO solution. 
          We put a small team together to find a solution that was articulated around OAuth 
          with existing customer WebSphere Application Server (WAS) instance. As a team, we:
        Details:
        - > 
          Implemented a J2EE servlet to deploy in WAS in order to report to our cloud services user roles and authorization.
        - Developed installation scripts to configure OAuth on WAS, as well as the J2EE servlet above.
        - >
          Changed the authentication flow within our cloud solution to use a WAS configured OAuth as part 
          of the authentication flow. This was solved by the development of a new cloud side service that essentially 
          proxy authentication to pluggable sources. This way although we target WAS OAuth, we could eventually reconfigure 
          to alternative authentication sources if we need to. 
        - Implemented verification CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins, with scripts to deploy both on-prems side as well as the cloud side. 
        - Evangelized TLS and how to use openssl to secure correctly all the end-points. This was probably the most underestimated part of this project.
        - Ran technical deep-dive sessions with our support department and customers

        Description: >
          As Kubernetes based environments rise in popularity, could our existing 
          and well tested on-premises product benefit from this new environment? 
          I defined the initial architecture and tried to define boundaries of this broad mission. 
          I then lead a team of 10 people to roll out this implementation. We then integrated all 
          this with a new set of cloud native analytics components developed by another team. 
          I lead and supervised:

        - Implemented associated helm chart for deployments.
